### Benchmarking makes choices easier but only uses past results.

When Tbonzer provides benchmarking, they provide a ranking algorithm that
returns results in the form of letter grades; or another hierarchical
structure. We can apply tried and true ranking algorithms to novel data. We
can also work with you to generate a custom ranking strategy. Benchmarking
returns the greatest value when it improves the clarity associated with choices
that include high-value consequences. Tbonzer team members have experience
partnering with organizations within Government to achieve win-win algorithms
that rank choices.
