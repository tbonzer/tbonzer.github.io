### Predictions anticipate the future but don't guarantee it.

Predictions from Tbonzer allow you to make informed decisions about future
events. We use statistical techniques similar to those used on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Tbonzer team members regualarly compete in Kaggle competitions.
We have multiple team members who have been classically trained in
[Econometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Econometrics) as full-scholarship
students in well-ranked PhD programs. Our results are presented intuitively
with technology that you already know such as [Microsoft Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel) or [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/). 


### Use Cases:

* Predict the success of new products being launched in your store
* Anticipate which people will respond best to your product or service
* Find out how likely your search results are to be relevant
* Reduce risk by predicting future costs
