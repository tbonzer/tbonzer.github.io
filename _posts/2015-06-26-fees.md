### Our fee structure accounts for products and services.


**Products**

If you would like Tbonzer to create and host a data product, we will bill by
using a subscription model. You will be provided with login credentials and
may continue using the data product as long as you pay the monthly subscription
fee. The subscription fee will depend on the data product. You can anticipate
the fee being in line with other subscription based web services.

**Services**

Clients are billed at *$100/hour* after an initial meeting to discuss your
project. This model ensures that we can flexibly assign the right combination
of expertise to your specific tasks. We will provide you with a estimate of the
number of hours required, a quote, and a start date as part of our [Memorandum of Understanding](docs/temp.pdf) (PDF). During the project you will receieve
detailed monthly billind updates and ongoing analysis results via a [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) project page.
