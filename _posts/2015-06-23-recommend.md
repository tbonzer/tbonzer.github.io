### Recommendations reduce uncertainty but don't predict the future.

A recommendation from Tbonzer is an analytical tool that helps you find the
best of something. We can make recommendations on a one-time or annual basis.
Our recommendations are made using statistical software such as [R](http://cran.r-project.org/), statistical libraries like [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
or databases like [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [Postgresql](http://www.postgresql.org/), or [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/). If you have a specific
tool you would like used, then we will strongly consider it.

### What are some use cases?

* Find the best music playlist for your organization based on your criteria
* Recommend the best restaurants in the area based on your needs
* Show you the best car dealerships based on reviews from multiple sources
* Generate a list of job candidates from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)
